# Code Labs Academy - Ticket list

## Introduction

This is one of the coding challenges for the Fundamentals unit of the web development bootcamp offered by [Code Labs Academy](https://codelabsacademy.com/). In this unit, we learn the major concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript while providing challenges and homeworks for an optimal hands-on learning experience.

## Challenge description

The challenge is to build a controlled form for booking flight tickets where each ticket is defined by a title, an assignee and a description.

The user should be able to:

- Add a new ticket.
- Remove an existing ticket.
- View all the tickets in the list (preferably in a table).
- Clear all the input fields of the form.

You show show an alert when:

- A new ticket is successfully added to the list.
- A ticket is successfully removed from the list.
- The user tries to submit the form with empty fields.

We already prepared the HTML code for you (along with some basic styling) to get you started, but feel free to add more styling and more features If needed.

To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of DOM manipulation, Events, and Object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

## Hints & Resources

- If you are just getting started with Object-oriented programming and DOM manipulation, you can check the list of issues that will walk you through the process of solving this challenge.
- This is a great [cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/es6) for ES6 JavaScript, you can check it out whenever you feel stuck.
